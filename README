Welcome to CS Squared's final project for PRA/B.
This is the ultimate culmination of 2 semesters of work to produce a real solution to a real problem.
Currently, the system involves prototypes for a Tesseract OCR model,
trained to extract text accurately from a PDF,
paired with a Spacy model to take the informated extracted from Tesseract and
extracting valuable vase references.

All Tesseract systems were handled by Michael Horina,
Spacy and the Django model were developed by Jackson Gleeson,
And the front handled and designed by Rajan Pusalkar

Installation instructions are avaliable in ‘installation.txt’.

If you have issues with the code and it’s desperate, contact Jackson Gleeson.
