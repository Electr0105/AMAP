figures on the obverses of nos. 347, 349 and 351 go closely together in the treatment 
of their drapery around and below the waist, which is very like that of the woman to 
left on the obverse of the Louvre Cadmus krater (no. 241). The sirens on the neck of 
nos. 347 and 349 are comparable to the one on the neck of Python's signed amphora 
(no. 240), and the standing draped woman on the reverse of no. 347 is very close to 
her counterpart on its reverse, where the treatment of the drapery around the waist 
is also very similar to that of the three women on nos. 347, 349 and 351 referred to 
above. No. 355 was previously associated with Asteas, but the draped woman on its 
reverse, the siren on the neck, and the bird-trap held by Eros all suggest it is better 
placed here, near to no. 352 in view of the close resemblance between the two draped 
figures to right on their reverses. The female heads on the necks mostly wear beaded 
sphendonai, although on no. 348 there is a radiate stephane in added white; their 
features tend to be rather heavy, with a flat brow-nose line and a strong chin. Part of 
the shoulder is occasionally visible, sometimes with a row of white beads down the 
sleeves as on nos. 347 and 355, and always with a black and/or white bead necklace.

(iii) Other Shapes 
This section contains a few vases of other shapes which, on stylistic grounds, look to 
be the work of Python or very closely associated with him. Of particular interest is 
the hydria from Pontecagnano now in the Salerno Museum (no. 367), which shows 
an Eros standing between a draped woman seated on a white tendril and a young 
Pan-satyr bending forward over his raised right foot which rests upon a similar 
tendril. The seated woman, for details of drapery, physical features and pose, should 
be compared with the women on nos. 256, 289, 353 and 357, also on the reverse of 
245 (for the beaded girdle); the Pan-satyr bending forward is a common type with 
Python, here the pose and drapery closely corresponds to that of Dionysos on the 
reverse of no. 306. The head below the handle on the left is very like that on the 
signed neck-amphora (no. 240), with a similar beaded bandeau; the other head is 
nearer to those on the necks of the amphorae in division (ii). There is also a 
connection with the work of the Painter of Wurzburg H 5739, who must have been a 
very close colleague of Python, to judge from the many elements their works have in 
common. 
The second hydria (no. 368) is unusual in that it depicts two nude women at a 
laver, a subject more commonly used for lebetes gamikoi, which perhaps explains 
why the scene is framed between reserved bands, not generally used on vases of this 
shape but common on the others. The vase suffered a very bad fissure in the firing, 
which completely split the body beside the right handle; the heads are in the typical 
Python manner. The black-draped woman on no. 370 finds a close parallel in the 
red-draped one on Bonn 3038 (no. 309); all three figures on no. 371 are familiar to us 
from other vases by Python, especially the papposilen to right. 
The kylix once in Ascona is perhaps by a close associate rather than the painter 
himself; indeed the Triton in the exergue recalls the similar figures by Asteas, but the 
standing draped woman is very much in Python's manner, like the papposilen. The 
four stemless cups are surely Python's own work, and very good examples of it, with 
his favourite bearded silens and young satyr with a wine-skin and pointed amphora, 
very like the one on the reverse of Louvre K368 (no. 318). All four have similar """,{"entities": [(39, 262, "VASE"),(264, 556, "VASE"),(558, 857, "VASE"),(919, 1013, "VASE"),]}),("""PYTHON  171

1. THE PAINTER OF WURZBURG H 5739 
The Painter of Wurzburg H5739 takes his name from a large neck-amphora, 
formerly in a German private collection and now in the Martin von Wagner 
Museum in Wurzburg. It is a vase of considerable interest for both subject-matter 
and  style, since it well illustrates many  of its painter's most  noteworthy 
characteristics.

(a) Makaria with the Herakleidai, two female busts above, [b) Al -I- A3c. 
Neck: [a) and [b) female head. 
The scene on the obverse shows a draped woman, with short hair, holding a 
bead-wreath and a mirror, seated upon an altar-like structure in front of an Ionic 
column, both in added white. She turns her head to left to look at a youth who wears 
a chlamys, with a petasos down his back, and holds a spear and a spray. There is a 
sheathed sword beneath his left arm; he stands upon ground indicated by rows of 
white dots. Balancing him to right is a second youth, also with spear and spray. 
Above, in typical Paestan fashion, are the busts of two women; they are set, as it 
were, in square panels, two sides of which are formed by the reserved framing band 
and the egg-pattern above the picture, the other two by wavy lines in added white 
(cf. Naples 1786, no. 385 below). 
The subject was originally thought by Schauenburg to represent the meeting 
between Orestes, Pylades and Electra at the tomb of Agamemnon, and the two busts 
above were taken to be those of two of the Furies (cf. with nos. 1, 144, 164, 244 
above, and with no. 1004, by the Boston Orestes Painter). As Erika Simon, however, 
pointed out, the figure seated on the altar was not holding a hydria (as Electra 
usually does in this context), and the two youths were both carrying 'suppliant 
boughs', which would be out of place for Orestes and Pylades; further, neither of the 
two busts had snakes in their hair or about their persons, and this would count 
against their identification as Furies. She thought the scene more probably depicted 
suppliants and suggested, as an alternative, that it represented the children of 
HeraklesâMakaria seated upon the altar, with one of her brothers on either side. 
She thought the two busts might represent two of Makaria's sisters, but, as we have 
seen, such busts in Paestan often seem to have no specific identity, but rather merely 
to represent spectators. 
The reverse represents two youths, draped in himatia with dot-stripe borders; 
on the rather tall neck, on each side, set into a framed oblong panel, are the head and 
shoulders of a woman in profile to left. The pictures on both sides are framed by 
reserved bands, but it is to be noted that these do not reach to the bottom, but are 
cut off by the scrolls on either side of the superposed palmette-fans below the 
handles, a practice also adopted on Paestum 20199 (no. 380). 
The amphora well illustrates a number of what prove to be highly characteristic 
features of the painter's style and enable us to distinguish his work from that of """,{"entities": [(464, 786, "VASE"),(427, 462, "SHAPE"),]}),("""176  THE RED-FIGURED VASES OF PAESTUM 
In the treatment of the figures we may note that: 
(vi) the heads are comparatively small, generally of neat appearance with a 
reserved line round the hair which, on male figures and especially Dionysos, is often 
long and falls down on to the shoulders in a series of curly locks. The headdresses 
varyâwe may have a plain circlet (as on the reverse) or a bead-wreath (Makaria), a 
leafy wreath (the two Herakleidai), a stephane (bust to right) or, and this type is 
very characteristic, a diadem with short rays on either side of a central band. 
(vii) the painter is fond of representing the hair of women with a large bunch 
sticking up at the back and tied round by a white ribbon, sometimes with dot-
clusters at the ends; otherwise a sphendone or kekryphalos is used, generally decorated 
with black and white dots, with a bunch of solid black hair at the back. Makaria's 
hair is cut short, as a suppliant, but the touch of pink on her cheek is very much after 
the manner of Python. 
In shape the amphora is close to those already attributed to Asteas and Python; 
the neck is slightly taller than usual and the handles are ribbed, as on Python's 
signed amphora. 
Two other neck-amphorae are obviously the work of the same hand, and go 
very closely with no. 379:

Neck: (a) and [b) female bust in profile to 1. 
The youths on the reverse of no. 380 are very like those on no. 379, especially in 
the treatment of the lower border of their himatia. On the piece of drapery over the 
left arm of the nude youth on the obverse we note the characteristically 'stepped' 
border; the treatment of the woman's breasts and the drapery around them 
corresponds with that on Makaria. Here we may note her pose, with one leg bent at 
the knee and crossed behind the other leg beneath the drapery, the vertical fold-lines 
on which are unaffected. The heads on the neck are also very similar, though 
somewhat less of the shoulders is visible. Both pictures are framed between vertical 
reserved bands; on no. 380 these stop short above the scrolls which curl out from the 
palmette-fans below the handles, exactly as on the preceding vase; the top left-hand 
corner of the obverse has a cross-bar which converts it into a triangle, as on so many 
of the Asteas-Python vases. 
The draped woman with one leg drawn back is repeated on no. 381, facing in 
the other direction. The treatment of her drapery is almost identical; on no. 381 she 
has long hair, which reaches down to the shoulders. The busts on the neck are like 
those on no. 379, and one has dotted rosettes on the upper portion of the chiton, as 
on the two busts at the top of the picture on that vase. No. 381 has a single figure on 
the reverse, a striding Dionysos with ivy-wreath (now partially lost) and shoulder-
length hair; we may note his rather prominent chin. """,{"entities": [(1315, 1581, "VASE"),(1583, 1912, "VASE"),]}),("""177

draped woman with fillet and phiale, and to r., half-draped youth with egg and stick; aboveâ 
two small white Erotes, one flying towards the standing woman to 1., the other to the seated 
woman; between them, a white bird, [b) standing draped woman, with 'skewer of fruit' and 
fillet, facing half-draped youth with fillet and wreath; between them, a palmette. 
Lid: (i) (a) panther, [b) bird; (ii)âbowl: (a) nude youth, [b) seated half-draped woman 
with phiale; (iii)âknob: moulded into the shape of a bird. 
The shoulder on the obverse is decorated with white plastic heads, set in a shrine-like 
structure, and on the reverse with a three-tiered conical projection. 
The treatment of the drapery, especially of its dot-stripe borders and around the 
women's breasts, the bunched hair, tied with ribbons, of the two women on the 
obverse, the standing figuresw ith the leg drawn back, and other details all show the 
vase to belong here. The elaborate lid is very typical of the larger Paestan lebetes 
gamikoi and the knob on top, moulded in the form of a bird, finds a close parallel on 
no. 185.

clandestinely to the Zurich market. Its present whereabouts is unknown to me. It does, however,

the other vases from the same tomb can be attributed. """,{"entities": [(112, 970, "VASE"),(1531, 1977, "VASE"),(1978, 2338, "VASE"),(2339, 2705, "VASE"),(2706, 2906, "VASE"),(97, 111, "SHAPE"),(1517, 1530, "SHAPE"),]}),("""178  THE RED-FIGURED VASES OF PAESTUM

Few of the above vases have any special interest of subject-matter, nearly all of 
them being decorated with stock themes from the general repertory of the Asteas-
Python workshop. It is possible that the cup, no. 394, represents Hermes and Io, but 
it is not easy to be certain of the identity of the seated woman, who wears a black 
peplos with touches of red and white as on the vases in the Black and Red Group by 
Asteas and who has a small pair of horns on her brow. The presence of Hermes in 
this context suggests that she might be more than an ordinary mortal (cf. also no. 
408 below). The phiale, no. 399, is of interest for its shape, perhaps copied from that 
of Paestum 26636 by Asteas, since it has the same white star in the centre, but is less 
elaborately decorated; the bell-krater Naples 1786 (no. 385) takes us back to the 
painter's name vase, since it has a very similar bust, framed by white wavy lines, 
above the pictures. 
In composition, drawing, decorative patterns and adjuncts, as well as in the 
treatment of the drapery, all the vases are closely linked together. We see the 
painter's favourite step-pattern on the dot-stripes on nos. 383-7, 395 and 397, with 
rows of dots on the drapery on nos. 383, 385, 397; the youths on the reverses of nos. 
383, 385-6 all follow his conventional types; the hair of the women on nos. 384â5, 
387 is,done in just the same fashion as on nos. 379 or 382. We may note also the 
drawing of the exposed breasts of the half-draped women on nos. 384, 387, 389, 390, 
392, 396-7, with one rounded and the other pointed, the nipples shown as black 
dots. The woman wearing a peplos, with a long overfall, usually with a double dot-
stripe down the centre, appears on no. 384 and is repeated on nos. 386-8, 391 and 
395; sometimes one of her legs is bent outwards to the left (nos. 336-7, 391), at others 
to the right (nos. 384, 388). We may note the repetition of the dot-piles, on which 
figures sit or rest one foot, on nos. 389-90 and 392, as well as of such decorative 
adjuncts as sprays of ivy, white rosettes, tambourines, pendant strings of white beads. 
The rather curious fillingo rnament, in the form of a triangle decorated with a black 
T with a black and white dot to left and right of the vertical stroke (PI. 121 b) is 
repeated on nos. 400 and 402 below, which are also closely connected in style with 
the other vases listed above. """,{"entities": [(68, 360, "VASE"),(361, 626, "VASE"),(627, 933, "VASE"),(942, 1127, "VASE"),(51, 67, "SHAPE"),(934, 941, "SHAPE"),]}),("""180  THE RED-FIGURED VASES OF PAESTUM

The connection of nos. 400 and 401 is clear from the step-patterns on the 
drapery, as well as from the treatment of the half-draped seated woman on no. 400. 
That of no. 402 is less certain, since the vase is in very bad condition, only part of the 
obverse and none of the reverse remaining. The shape, decorative patterns, the 
framing of the pictures and the half-laver to left all link it with no. 401; the drapery 
of the woman, with the horizontal rows of dots, also suggests that it might well be 
placed here. 
Two other skyphoi seem also to be by this painter, though they show slight 
differences of treatment in the drawing and the drapery.

The first seems clearly to belong here, from the treatment of the naked woman 
on the obverse and the half-draped one on the reverse. The standing woman on the 
obverse is, at least to a certain extent, comparable to those on nos. 387 and 391, 
where we see a similar peplos with a long overfall and one leg bent, as well as much 
the same treatment of the drapery in the area of the breasts. On this skyphos, 
however, the dots accompanying the central stripe move from left to right as they 
descend, exactly as they do also on no. 404. The skyphos in the Chateau de Nohant 
was kindly brought to my notice by Dr. Dietrich von Bothmer and is known to me 
only from a photo-copy; such is the similarity between the standing woman on its 
obverse and that on no. 402 that they ought to be by the same painter. Here both 
pictures are framed between reserved bands as against framing palmettes on the 
reverse of no. 403, but otherwise the decoration is very similar. """,{"entities": [(47, 458, "VASE"),(468, 784, "VASE"),(785, 1183, "VASE"),(1838, 2076, "VASE"),(2077, 2273, "VASE"),(39, 46, "SHAPE"),(459, 467, "SHAPE"),]}),("""OTHER PAINTERS IN THE ASTEAS-PYTHON WORKSHOP  181 
(iii) More developed in style 
We come now to a group of vases which, while still connected in style with those in 
(i) and (ii) above, differ somewhat from them in treatment and have certain marked 
characteristics of their own, notably in the heavier heads with their strongly 
pronounced chins which may be seen on many of the vases (e.g. nos. 408-12). They 
may well represent a more developed phase in the artist's career, since the heads 
below the handles on no. 409 find very close parallels in the heads on nos. 379 (bust, 
top left) and 382, and there are other points of resemblance (e.g.. in the half-draped 
women on nos. 405, 411 and 412; the dotted drapery on no. 406), but it will be noted 
that we no longer find the steps on the dot-stripe borders, and that the fold-lines 
across the drapery over the legs of seated figures assume a marked horizontal 
tendency (as on nos. 405, 411-12), which was not present before. We should also note 
the rendering of the faces with the very heavy chins, the slight downward curve to 
the mouth and the general look of severity, which is very apparent in the heads 
below the handles of the hydriai (nos. 406-9) as well as on the standing draped 
woman on no. 408 and the seated half-draped woman on nos. 410^11. 
The skyphos (no. 405) is similar in decoration to no. 402, with the same red 
fillets looped over the cross-bars of the triangles in the top left corners, and the half-
visible laver is also closely comparable, with the same black lines for the fluting on 
the pedestal; physically the seated Dionysos reminds us of the youth to left on the 
obverse of no. 379 and the head of the woman on the reverse recalls that of the 
woman on no. 395, but is still closer to the head below the left handle of no. 406. 
The heads below the handles of the four hydriai (nos. 406-9) have much in 
common between themâthe downward curve of the mouth, the heavy, rounded 
chin, the drawing of the eyes, and, despite superficial differences, look to be the work 
of one painter (cf. also the heads on no. 410). The head of the seated woman on 
Warsaw 147160 (no. 411) is duplicated on the lekanis lid (no. 412), which is also 
extremely like those below the handles of no. 408. The superposed palmette-fans 
below the handles on the skyphos (no. 405) are comparable to those on no. 408, 
where the two component elements do not meet, as also on no. 409 where, however, 
the leaves of the lower fan turn inwards (cf. the skyphos no. 403). The hydriai seem 
to have drawn their inspiration from those by Asteas (cf. especially nos. 70-74 above, 
for the posing of the figures, the drapery and the palmettes below the handles); it will 
be noted that the standard framing palmettes appear behind the heads, except on 
no. 467, of which a good deal is missing.

The vases in this division are closely related in style to the work of the Painter of 
Wurzburg H5739; those in (a) might even be by his own hand, but those in (b) are 
not sufficiently well preserved to be certain of such an attribution. 
The three following vases are the work of one hand and are closely interconnected by 
the treatment of the drapery borders, which combine dot-stripe with plain black. 
The lower border of the himatia of the two right-hand figures on the reverses of nos. 
413-4 is drawn in a very similar manner; on the youth to left on the latter it breaks 
up in the corner into a series of small black strokes, comparable to those on the piece 
of drapery over the arm of the youth on the reverse of no. 415. The standing woman 
on the obverse of no. 413 should be compared with those on the two skyphoi nos.

nos. 379, 382 and 385. The obverse of no. 414 has a similar theme to that of no. 383, 
though there the papposilen is better drawn. The draped youth to left on its reverse 
is very like his counterpart on no. 379, where, however, the himation has the typical 
'stepped' border. The himation of the draped woman on the pelike no. 415 has the 
characteristic double curve in the lower right-hand corner, as on nos. 379 and 385 
(cf. Fig. 6 b). All these correspondences in detail suggest that if these vases are not by 
the painter himself, they are the work of a very close imitator.

No. 416 might also be by the painter himself. The heads on the neck are like 
those on no. 379 and the treatment of the dot-stripes on the drapery is also very 
much in his manner. Unfortunately most of the detail has now disappeared and, in 
consequence, it is not possible to see how the breasts of the half-draped woman were 
treated. No. 417 is even less well preserved, but the standing draped woman is 
comparable with the one on no. 387 and the youth with the corresponding figures on 
nos. 395 and 412. On no. 417 the pictures are framed between reserved bands, but 
not the heads on the neck; on no. 416 the opposite is the case.

This is one of the more interesting of the vases from the Asteas-Python 
workshop, both for subject and style, and it is surprising that as yet no other vase 
seems specifically attributable to the artist who painted it, though it clearly is very 
closely connected with the work of Asteas and of the Painter of Wurzburg H5739. 
The scene on the obverse, which is framed between reserved bands, with a 
triangle in the top left corner, over the crossbar on which a fillet is draped as on nos. 
402 and 405, represents Orestes about to slay his mother Clytemnestra. He is nude, 
except for a chlamys, with embroidered patterns and plain black border, which 
hangs down his back along with a pilos in added white. He has high laced boots and 
stands on rocky ground, his left leg resting on some eminence behind his victim; with 
his right hand he grasps the sword he has drawn from its scabbard, and with his left 
grabs a lock of Clytemnestra's hair, no doubt in readiness to expose her throat to his 
sword. She raises her right hand in a gesture of despairing entreaty, and with her left 
covers her bared right breast. She wears a chiton and has a piece of drapery wrapped 
round the lower part of her body. Both have a large number of fine fold-lines, the 
chiton a central dot-stripe, the other piece of drapery a dot-stripe border. In the top 
right corner appears the bust of a Fury, in huntress costume, with a snake entwined 
in her hair and two others, wrapped round each arm. 
The himatia of the two youths on the reverse also have dot-stripe borders; their 
pose recalls that on nos. 171, 177 and 183 by Asteas or no. 271 by Python, but we 
should note the bent leg of the youth to right, which is drawn much further back 
than would be usual on a vase by either of those two artists. 
The drawing is careful and the fold-lines of the drapery are shown in great 
detail, often appearing in small clusters. In this regard it has elements in common 
with the work of the Painter of Wurzburg H5739: we may compare both the head 
and the drapery of Clytemnestra with those of Makaria on the latter's name vase. 
The Getty amphora, however, is a more powerful piece: it is not overcrowded like 
some of Python's larger vases, it renders a dramatic moment with strong, but not 
over-emphasised, emotion, leaving one with some sense of regret that more works by 
the same hand have not yet come to light. 
3. THE PAINTER OF PAESTUM 21602 
Only two vases can, as yet, be attributed to this painter, a lebes gamikos of 
comparatively elaborate design and a stemless cup.

H5739, but it should be noted that at the neck the peplos on no. 419 assumes a V-
shape, as on no. 418, and lack the 'collar' favoured by the other painter. The cup was 
found together with a lekanis (inv. 21600) which has been associated above with 
Asteas (no. 205).

(a) Nude youth bending forward, drapery over 1. shoulder, to standing draped veiled 
woman; Ionic column in background, [b) Air, with stick, +A2r, with spray. 
Neck: (a) female head, [b) owl. 
In PAdd (p. 5) it was noted in regard to the hydria (no. 421), which was there 
placed in the workshop of Asteas and Python as closely related to the former, that in 
style it 'stands a little apart from the other vases in this group and seems to be the 
work of a new painter, to whom as yet no other vases can be definitely assigned.' We 
now have at least one, and possibly two, other vases by this painter who is an artist of 
no great merit, but is possessed of a very characteristic style, which manifests itself 
particularly in his drawing of the faces. Those of the figures on the body and below 
the handles of the hydria provide excellent illustrations of this. We should note the 
drawing of (i) the eyeâthree more or less parallel strokes for the brow and upper lid, 
a large black dot for the pupil, (ii) the mouthâdeep set, with thick lips and a 
substantial indent above the rounded chin, (iii) the noseâshort, curving lines to 
mark the nostril; straight, slightly concave brow-nose line, (iv) the hairâshown as a 
solid black mass, sometimes with straggly curls around the ear. These features will 
also be found on the neck-amphora (no. 422). 
The treatment of the drapery is also noteworthy. On the hydria, the woman 
wears a long peplos, with a central double dot-stripe which falls vertically down to 
the lower hem, her right leg is bent at the knee and over the thigh the fold-lines of the 
drapery are shown as a series of double horizontal strokes, slightly curved; similar 
vertical fold-lines appear on the chlamys of the youth, the small weights at the 
corners of which are clearly shown. The owl between the two is a formidable bird, 
with staring eyes. 
The woman on the obverse of the neck-amphora wears a similar peplos, but has 
a piece of drapery drawn up over her head to serve as a veil, and falling over her left 
shoulder, enveloping her left arm. The chlamys of the youth beside her has a wave-
pattern border. Both stand in front of an Ionic column on a three-stepped base, 
which must represent a tomb-monument, but it is difficult to see the scene as more 
than generic. On the reverse are two draped youths wearing himatia with plain 
black bordersâthe youth to left finds parallels on vases like nos. 37-8, 42, 87-8, 176, """,{"entities": [(429, 692, "VASE"),(707, 980, "VASE"),(421, 428, "SHAPE"),(693, 706, "SHAPE"),]}),("""OTHER PAINTERS IN THE ASTEAS-PYTHON WORKSHOP  187 
by Asteas, whose influence is certainly apparent on both. The drawing of their faces, 
however, places them here. On the neck of the obverse is a female head, wearing a 
radiate stephane, and on the reverse an owl, of somewhat less ferocious aspect than 
on the hydria. Below the handles are superposed palmette-fans, with detached side-
tendrils of a fairly early type (cf. Fig. 3, HID), and the appearance of a somewhat 
similar one on the hydria suggests that these two vases are not very late. 
The hydria comes from a tomb (Andriuolo, 1954, no. 2) which included a 
pelike (inv. 5394) near in style to the Thyrsus Painter, a lebes gamikos (inv. 5398) 
associated with Asteas (no. 200), and a lekanis (inv. 5392) of the Asteas-Python 
Group (no. 635); also several vases decorated in applied red (PAdd, p. 26, nos. 
AR 4â7; see Appendix I), which again come from the Asteas-Python workshop. The 
neck-amphora (no. 422) comes from a tomb which included some of the vases 
associated with the earlier work of Asteas, e.g. nos. 15, 16, 104 above (inv. 22449, 
22443, 22441), which tends to confirm the suggestion of a not unduly late date for 
these vases, probably c. 350 B.C. 
The following vase looks to be closely connected with the above, especially in 
the treatment of the draped youths on its reverse, and it may well be by the same 
hand.

(a) Bearded silen with torch and phiale running to 1., followed by Dionysos, with phiale 
and thyrsus, drapery over both arms, [b) Bv, with stick (repainted), + variant on A2r. 
In PPSupp this vase was attributed to Asteas, and the obverse is clearly very 
much in his manner, especially in the rendering of the bearded silen (cf. nos. 46, 175, 
181); the reverse, however, differs considerably in style from those of the standard 
Asteas vases, making allowance for the repainted white wreaths round the heads of 
the youths and the curious staff between them, the top of which has been 
transformed into a sort of leafy plant. The drawing of their faces is very like that of 
those of the two figures on the hydria (no. 421), with the same eyes, nose, mouth and 
chin: the youth to left is particularly close. He also finds good parallels on many of 
the bell-kraters associated with Asteas (e.g. nos. 42, 50-1, 61-2, 171, 177), as also 
does the figure of Dionysos on the obverse (cf. with nos. 36, 51-2, 59, 174). All these 
points of resemblance tend to confirm the conclusion that these vases are contempor 
ary with the middle phase of Asteas's activity and seem to be the work of a follower, 
whose drawing of facial features was rather clumsy (cf. also the neck-amphora no. 91 
above, which is near to no. 422, but slightly better drawn). 
5. THE KURASHIKI PAINTER 
The last of the painters to be discussed in this chapter is by far the worst; the 
Kurashiki Painter, who takes his name from the museum in Okayama, Japan, which 
possesses one of his bell-kraters (no. 424 below), is an artist of very inferior quality, 
who models his style upon that of Asteas, but with a singular lack of success. In 
PPSupp and PAdd three of the vases now attributed to him were placed in the general 
Asteas Group, but it is clear that all are the work of a single painter, whose manner """,{"entities": [(1414, 1671, "VASE"),(1401, 1413, "SHAPE"),]}),("""188  THE RED-FIGURED VASES OF PAESTUM 
of drawing draped youths is particularly characteristic. Their himatia generally 
have a deep U, with inward curving sides, over the chest, bordered in black; the 
lower borders are plain black and slightly wavy, the fold-lines are clearly indicated 
by rows of parallel lines, and the left hand of the youth to left sticks out beneath the 
drapery. Prototypes will be found on vases like nos. 46-7, 92-3 174-5, but now the 
drawing, especially of the faces, has become very slovenly. It is interesting to contrast 
the Pan on no. 424 a and the bearded silen on no. 425 with those on nos. 39 and 57, 
46, 175 and 181 by Asteas and to see how the Kurashiki Painter has taken over a 
stock type and debased it; the same is equally true of the maenad or the seated 
Dionysos on no. 424, and of the other figures on his obverses.

PYTHON WORKSHOP 
This chapter lists well over 500 vases of smaller dimensions, grouped into three main 
sections according to the nature of their decoration. Section 1 deals mainly with 
vases in a great variety of shapes decorated with single figures (woman, youth, satyr, 
Eros, bird, etc.) taken over from larger compositions; it includes a few with two-
figure scenes, which were not specifically attributable to any of the painters discussed 
in Chapters IV-VIII. Section 2 lists those vases decorated only with heads (of 
women, youths, satyrs) and section 3 fish-plates. All these vases are products of the 
Asteas-Python workshop, but in most cases the style is so stereotyped that it is 
extremely difficult to assign a given vase to a specific painter, and they seem more 
probably to be the work of those 'well-drilled associates' to whom reference has 
already been made (p. 55 above). When it seemed feasible to indicate a possible 
closer connection with a known painter, this has been done. 
Some early minor vases which are closely associated with Asteas have already 
been listed in Chapter IV, section 3, nos. 99-124. A few of the later ones (e.g. nos. 
436-7; 442-3) provide a clear connecting link with the early vases connected with' 
the Painter of Naples 2585 (e.g. nos. 3/323-330). 
1. VASES DECORATED WITH FIGURED COMPOSITIONS 
Bell-kraters 
(a) 
The single figures on either side of the bell-kraters are already familiar to us from the 
larger bell-kraters listed in the preceding chapters. The seated woman on Sydney 
49.10 (no. 428), bunched up in the himation which completely envelops her, is quite 
a popular figure on the minor vases; the Eros on the reverse has a pronounced chin, 
and the same phenomenon may be noted on a number of other vases in this chapter, 
which form a small sub-group around the Sydney krater.1 
It will be noted that on nos. 427-8 there is no pattern-work below the main 
picture; on nos. 430-1 wave-pattern in black on a reserved stripe with a black band 
and a further reserved stripe above it. Standard framing palmettes are used; on nos. 
427 and 430, the lower fan is sometimes replaced by a single drop-leaf (cf. no. 346). 
On nos. 427 and 430 a large wave-pattern is used under the rim in place of the more 
normal laurel (cf. also nos. 436-8 and the handle-zone on the calyx-krater no. 439).

Pelikai 
The minor pelikai are normally of comparatively small size, mostly between 14 and 
20 cm. in height. The mouth is wide; the handles come up to and almost touch the 
overhanging rim; the body reaches its maximum width more than half way down, 
and then curves slightly inwards towards a simple disk foot. Above the pictures there 
is either a band of egg-pattern, or a somewhat larger reserved area decorated with 
black tongues; below, there is normally only a reserved stripe. Below the handles are 
large single fan-palmettes without other forms of framing, although there is 
sometimes a tall scroll beside them. The figured decoration closely follows that on 
the neck-amphorae. 
An earlier example of this shape may be seen in Paestum 5639 (no. 116 above), 
associated with Asteas; Naples 85990, connected with the Painter of Wurzburg 
H 5739 (no. 415), is contemporary with the pelikai listed below, and very similar in 
style to several of them.

Hydriai 
The hydriai range in height from 18 to 23 cm., the average being about 20. The neck 
is decorated with laurel, egg-pattern or tongues and the figures generally run up on 
to the shoulder, which is, in consequence, undecorated. Behind the back-handle 
there is normally a single large palmette-fan, sometimes with framing palmettes, 
either beside it or beneath the handles.

hydriai (nos. 518 and 562) have owls instead. A small stele or altar will often be 
found on one side of the figure. 
The subjects show little variation from those on the neck-amphorae or pelikai. 
The seated half-draped woman and the running or striding nude youth, with a piece 
of drapery over one arm, are very popular. 
(i) With two figures 
The hydria in Japan (no. 518) is known to me only from a photo-copy kindly sent me 
by Dr. Akira Mizuta. It looks close in style to the Painter of Wurzburg H5739 to 
judge from the drapery of the seated woman and the drawing of her breasts, but 
without a fuller knowledge of it it seemed safer to place it here. The hydria in 
Paestum (no. 519), though two-figured, is comparatively small; it has no heads 
below the handles and also seemed better placed here.
